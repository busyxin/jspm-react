# jspm-react
Trying out jspm/systemjs with react

It's a small react component with modules loaded via Systemjs where we fetch the repos from github. (It is hardcoded to jackfranklin in repository-list.js)

Should work with:

- npm install
- jspm install
- node server.js

Run "make build" to bundle with jspm bundle-sfx.
Find bundled files in /dist.
